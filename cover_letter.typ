#text()[*Dear Hiring Manager,*]

I am writing to express my interest in the software developer position at your organization. With a proven track record of rapidly adapting to new environments and solving challenging problems, I believe I can bring valuable contributions to your team.

Throughout my career, I have been entrusted with projects that were abandoned, undocumented, and lacked any knowledge transfer. Despite these obstacles, I consistently managed to understand, revive, and deliver results—meeting client expectations and earning recognition for my efforts. In one such case, I received an "Excellent Individual Contributor" award for taking ownership of a complex system built on a closed-source framework with no documentation.

I am a self-taught software developer who thrives on learning. Four years ago, I began my journey with Rust and have since gained hands-on experience with #text(blue)[Actix, Actix-web, Serde, Tokio, SQLx, and Sea-ORM]. I am also an active contributor to open source Rust projects and was a core member of a team that successfully migrated a production codebase from SQLx to Sea-ORM ensuring performance, maintainability, and a smoother developer experience across the project.

I enjoy tackling unfamiliar technologies and turning ambiguity into structure. I take pride in being the kind of developer who, when thrown into the deep end, will swim - learning quickly and delivering on time.

I’m excited by the opportunity to work with teams that value autonomy, initiative, and depth of understanding. I would welcome the chance to contribute my problem-solving mindset, open-source experience, and technical skills to your organization.

Thank you for considering my application. I would be happy to discuss how I can support your engineering goals.

Best regards,\
